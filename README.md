Program that allows anyone to access The Metropolitan Museum of Art's extensive art collections, simply by selecting the department of your choice. 
A piece of art and its information is displayed with every click, courtesy of the museum's comprehensive API.

## Optimizations
One of the top optimizations is adding a feature to store a user's favorite pieces of art in the DOM. I would also like to add mobile-first styling. Finally, there is an error with the server attempting to set a cookie and it doesn't have the SameSite attribute set. Since I am working client side on this project, there isn't much I can do, however I'm keeping aware in case there is something that can be done in the future.

## Lessons Learned

Utilized multiple fetch methods to pull layers of information from the backend, and enjoyed refactoring the nested fetches to make the code more readable.
